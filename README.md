# Maker Teams (REST API)

Maker Teams REST API is an interface between the application and the database, as well as users and the database. It requires authentication in the form of a token. Tokens are generated for new users so we can keep track of who is making which request (and how many times). The Maker Teams application itself authenticates with a token as well, but is also authorized with special admin privileges.
